# Veles - A new age tool for binary analysis

![A .tar file as seen in Veles](resources/screens/tarball.png)

It is a very difficult task for a human to notice subtle patterns in large
amounts of binary data, however, us humans are very good at finding patterns in
images. Statistical visualizations let you find the important bits in a sea of
binary data - all at a glance.
