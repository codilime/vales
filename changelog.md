# Veles changelog

## 2017.01.0.MechanicalTurk (2017-01-26)

### Major features and changes:

  * Added network protocol that allows using external scripts as ad-hoc parsers. Added a simple Python library to support using this functionality. Check out python/README.rst for details.
    * For security reasons network server is disabled by default and has to be enabled in the options dialog.
    * This feature is still in an early phase of development and the API will change in future releases.
  * Added a few parsers for well known file formats (avi, bmp, elf, gif, pe, mov, zip). New parsers have been generated from Kaitai template files (https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct). Support for user-provided Kaitai files is planned in upcoming releases.
