/** Repacks binary data to a different element width.  Repacking conceptually
    works as follows:

    1. All source elements starting from the given index, are glued
       together to form a big string of bits.  If LITTLE endian is selected,
       lower-indexed elements are less significant in the resulting
       string, otherwise they are more significant.
    2. Starting from LSB (for LITTLE endian) or MSB (for BIG
       endian) of the resulting string, num_elements * (format.width +
       format.lowPad + format.highPad) bits are extracted and cut into
       num_elements pieces (again ordered according to the selected
       endian).
    3. From each of the num_element pieces, high highPad and low lowPad bits
       are cut off, and the rest is returned as the result.

    Of course, the actual repacking operation only reads as many source
    elements as are actually necessary to determine the output.  This number
    can be determined by the repackSize() function.  It is an error if fewer
    elements than that are available in the source.  */
