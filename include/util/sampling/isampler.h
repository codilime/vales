/**
 * Abstract interface for Sampler classes.
 * The idea is that any Sampler wraps a byte stream and performs sampling
 * to return a small, representative sample.
 * Specific sample size can be requested by user, but this is only treated
 * as a suggestion and the implementation may return a sample of different
 * size.
 *
 * By default the sampler works synchronously - any call that creates
 * the need to re-create sample ("resample") will perform the resampling
 * operation immediately. As this can be rather expensive time-wise
 * the sampler can be changed to asynchronous mode. In that case the resampling
 * is performed in a separate thread and a set of registered callbacks is
 * called once it's done.
 *
 * When working in asynchronous mode it is recommended to perform any
 * operations on the data while keeping the mutex returned by sampler.lock().
 * Otherwise the sample we're looking at can suddenly change leading to
 * inconsistencies.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * MySampler sampler(some_data);
 * MySampler.setSampleSize(2048);
 * for (int i = 0; i < sampler.getSampleSize(); ++i) {
 *   appendByteToMyDataStructure(sampler[i]);
 * }
